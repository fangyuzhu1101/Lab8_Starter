# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

Answer: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
Explanation: By automating tests within a GitHub action triggered on code push, it can establish a continuous feedback, improve code quality, and maintain a reliable and efficient development pipeline. For example, it can help early detection of issues to identify any issues early in the development process. It also can provide continuous or immediate feedback. In addition, automating tests ensures that they are executed consistently and reliably across every code change or push. Manual testing can be time-consuming and error-prone.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
Answer: No. End-to-end tests are designed to simulate real user interactions with an application, covering multiple components and workflows. They validate the integration and behavior of the whole system. To verify if a specific function is returning the correct output, unit tests are commonly used.
